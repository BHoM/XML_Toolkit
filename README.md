### Welcome to XML_Toolkit :notes:

The Green Building XML schema (gbXML) is an open schema developed to facilitate transfer of building data stored in Building Information Models (BIM) to engineering analysis tools. gbXML eliminates the need to re-enter the same building data and information over and over again into multiple building analysis tools. gbXML is being integrated into a range of software CAD and engineering tools and supported by leading 3D BIM vendors. Please find out more about gbXML here: http://www.gbxml.org/

XML_Toolkit helps by generating cleaner and better quality gbXML files.

Anyone can use XML_Toolkit, regardless of experience using Grasshopper, DynamoBIM or Excel or background as an MEP/Building Physics engineer or otherwise. To get started, **see guidance on the [Wiki](https://github.com/BHoM/XML_Toolkit/wiki) page.**
If you have any queries, feel free to contact any of the those accredited below for further guidance.
