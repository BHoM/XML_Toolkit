### Welcome to gbXML_Toolkit :notes:

gbXML is an industry supported schema for sharing building information between wide range of building simulatio software tools.  
gbXML eliminates the need to re-enter the same building data and informatin over and over again into multiple building analysis tools.

XML_Toolkit helps you to generate cleaner and better quality of gbXML files.

The Green Building XML schema (gbXML) is an open schema developed to facilitate transfer of building data stored in Building Information Models (BIM) to engineering analysis tools. gbXML is being integrated into a range of software CAD and engineering tools and supported by leading 3D BIM vendors. 
Please find out more about schema XML_Toolkit http://www.gbxml.org/

**Check [Wiki](https://github.com/BHoM/XML_Toolkit/wiki) to get started** with your journey regardless if you are MEP engineer, Architect or Energy modeler using Grasshopper, DynamoBIM or Excel.
